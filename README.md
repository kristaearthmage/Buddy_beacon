## 🌈 Why It Exists

We built Buddy Beacon to bring **fun, structure, and empowerment** to shared living spaces—especially for ADHD households, kids with big imaginations, and overtasked parents looking for a spark of magic in the mundane. You shouldn’t have to dread your to-do list. It should invite you on a quest.
